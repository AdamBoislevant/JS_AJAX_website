        <p id="Interests">
          Iâ€™m passionate about technology, especially AI and 3D simulation, and
          I love exploring new advancements in these fields. I enjoy doing
          sports like calisthenics or workout. Outdoor activities like hiking
          and climbing keep me active. Traveling to experience different
          cultures and broaden my perspective is something I cherish.

          I have already realized 3 websites as part of my studies. all of them
          were e-shops or marketplaces. Also I created a webApp when I was doing
          my internship in Generali VIE, this webApp was meant to prompt the SSO
          token of the user depending of his/her environment (production,
          pre-production,...).

          My goal for now is to get a job in the visual computing sector. I
          would be glad to work on simulations using unreal engines for example.
          I don't have a lot of expectations as long as my work is stimulating
          and interesting.
